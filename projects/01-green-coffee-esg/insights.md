# Insights — Green Coffee ESG

## Preliminary Insight 01: Supply Concentration Risk

**Finding**: Coffee sourcing decisions in Europe depend heavily on a small number of origins with increasing exposure to environmental and social risks.

**Data Signal**: Production concentration among Brazil and Colombia (>75% of analyzed volume) creates material supply chain risk. Single-country climate shock, policy change, or labor disruption poses business continuity threat.

**ESG Dimension**: 
- Environmental: Climate exposure concentrated in highest-volume origins
- Social: Labor availability & stability concentrated in 2 countries
- Economic: Price volatility exposure through supply bottlenecks

**Strategic Implication**: Early data suggests that production concentration and socio-economic conditions differ significantly across countries, creating ESG trade-offs that require structured decision frameworks.

**Next Action**: Build ESG scoring model to compare origins systematically.

## Preliminary Insight 02: Growth ≠ Sustainability

**Finding**: Growth trajectories differ significantly across origins. Fast growth (Brazil) vs. stable production (Colombia) signal different development models.

**Data Signal**: Production growth may indicate land expansion; sustainability not correlated with volume growth.

**ESG Dimension**: 
- Environmental: Expansion into marginal lands (deforestation risk)
- Social: Employment intensity changes with mechanization
- Economic: Price pressure from volume-driven competition

**Strategic Implication**: Higher production growth doesn't equal better ESG performance. Certification + compliance data needed to separate true sustainability from simple volume expansion.
