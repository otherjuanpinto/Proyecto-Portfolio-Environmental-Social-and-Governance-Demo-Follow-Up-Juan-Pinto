# Project 04 – Climate Risk Mapping for Coffee Regions

## 1. Context
Climate variability threatens agricultural productivity and supply chain resilience.

## 2. Objective
Map climate risks and vulnerability for coffee-producing regions.

## 3. Scope
- Sector: Coffee agriculture
- Geography: Major coffee-producing regions (LAC, Africa, Asia)
- Time horizon: 2030–2050 climate scenarios
- Stakeholders: Sourcing, risk, strategy teams

## 4. Data Sources
- IPCC projections
- WorldClim
- FAO datasets
- CLIMADA or similar models

## 5. Analytical Approach
Spatial analysis, climate scenario modeling, vulnerability indexing.

## 6. Outputs
- Risk maps
- Vulnerability index
- Adaptation scenarios

## 7. Value Generated
Enables forward-looking climate adaptation strategies and supply chain diversification.
