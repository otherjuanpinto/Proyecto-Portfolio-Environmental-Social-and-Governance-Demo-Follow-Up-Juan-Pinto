# Portfolio ESG+ | Juan Paulo Pinto Sandoval

Strategic ESG, sustainability and data-driven projects focused on
green coffee supply chains, European regulation (CSRD), climate risk
and decision-making analytics.

This portfolio is not a collection of courses or exercises.
It is a set of **consulting-style projects** designed to demonstrate
how data, strategy and sustainability come together to inform
real-world decisions.
