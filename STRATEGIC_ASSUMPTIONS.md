# Strategic Assumptions Portfolio
## Project-COS-01: Green Coffee ESG Intelligence

**Date:** February 2026  
**Scope:** 6 integrated projects analyzing coffee supply chain sustainability  
**Audience:** Importers, ESG teams, CFO, board-level stakeholders  

---

## 📌 Executive Summary: The Unified Story

The coffee supply chain faces a **systemic sustainability crisis** that is simultaneously a **strategic opportunity**. The crisis is driven by:

1. **Concentration risk** → Few countries (Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia) control >70% supply
2. **Income instability** → Farmers earn 50% below living income thresholds
3. **Climate uncertainty** → Key production zones face tipping points 2040-2050
4. **Regulatory acceleration** → CSRD + CSDDD mandate supply chain disclosure by 2027-2028
5. **Logistics inefficiency** → Cost + carbon unnecessarily high due to fragmented networks

**Strategic response:** Companies that act NOW—building ESG infrastructure, diversifying origins, stabilizing farmer income, optimizing logistics—will gain:

- **Supply resilience** (reduced climate + political risk)
- **Cost efficiency** (12-20% logistics savings, better margins)
- **Regulatory compliance** (CSRD/CSDDD ready; audit-proof)
- **Brand differentiation** (credible sustainability story)
- **Financial upside** (income support ROI positive within 3-5 years)

## 🔗 Cross-Project Assumption Links

### Link 1: Supply Concentration Drives Climate Risk → Logistics Complexity

```
Project 01 (Green Coffee ESG Intelligence)
  ↓ Observation: Brazil dominates (35%+ supply)
  ↓ Interpretation: Concentrated supply = concentrated climate risk
  ↓ Assumption: Need diversification
  ↓
Project 04 (Climate Risk Mapping)
  ↓ Observation: Brazil faces water stress 2040-2045
  ↓ Observation: East Africa emerging as new origin opportunity
  ↓
Project 06 (Sustainable Logistics)
  ↓ Implication: Diversification requires rerouting: LAC → new routes East Africa
  ↓ Assumption: Consolidation + route optimization enable efficient new routes
```

**Business outcome:** Diversification strategy is NOT just "ESG virtue"; it's operationally feasible + financially positive (lower logistics cost with optimization).

---

### Link 2: Farmer Income Instability Blocks Climate Adaptation

```
Project 05 (Living Income)
  ↓ Observation: Farmers earn 50% below living income threshold
  ↓ Interpretation: Liquidity constraint prevents adoption of climate-smart practices
  ↓ Assumption: Income stabilization enables adaptation adoption
  ↓
Project 04 (Climate Risk Mapping)
  ↓ Observation: Farmers with capital can invest in agroforestry / elevation shift
  ↓ Observation: Without capital, farmers are passive victims of climate shock
  ↓
Project 02 (Carbon Footprint)
  ↓ Implication: Scope 3 emissions reduction depends on farmer income = farmer investment capacity
  ↓ Assumption: Income support isn't CSR; it's core to decarbonization pathway
```

**Business outcome:** CSRD carbon target (Scope 3 reduction) is achievable ONLY if farmer income is stabilized. Income support is NOT discretionary; it's infrastructure for carbon compliance.

---

### Link 3: Regulatory Requirements Drive Data Infrastructure → All Projects

```
Project 03 (CSRD Readiness)
  ↓ Observation: CSRD requires 1,300+ data points from supply chain
  ↓ Observation: Mid-size companies report <200 points today
  ↓ Assumption: Data infrastructure gap is structural bottleneck
  ↓
All Other Projects (01, 02, 04, 05, 06)
  ↓ Data collection requirement:
  ↓   - Project 01: Supplier ESG scorecard data
  ↓   - Project 02: Farm-level emissions + farming practices data
  ↓   - Project 04: Climate exposure + weather data + farmer adaptive capacity data
  ↓   - Project 05: Farm-level income data
  ↓   - Project 06: Shipment-level carbon tracking + route data
  ↓
  ↓ Overlap: All projects feed into CSRD-compliant data warehouse
  ↓ Assumption: Build data infrastructure once; serve all projects (not separately)
```

**Business outcome:** CSRD investment (estimated €200-400K Year 1) is NOT stand-alone compliance cost; it's foundational infrastructure enabling ALL 6 projects simultaneously.

## 🎯 Strategic Assumptions by Theme

### Theme 1: Supply Chain Concentration = Risk Engine

| Project | Core Assumption | Implication |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **01 - Green Coffee ESG** | Supply concentration (70%+ from 3 countries) creates ESG exposure | Must diversify origins; can't be 50%+ single country |
| **04 - Climate Risk** | Brazil water stress 2045, Vietnam stress 2035-2040 | Diversification into East Africa required by 2030; lead time 5-10 years |
| **06 - Logistics** | Diversification toward Africa requires rerouting + consolidation | Optimization unlocks East Africa sourcing economics |

**Unified assumption:** Concentration is no longer a cost advantage; it's a risk liability. Diversification is strategy.

---

### Theme 2: ESG is Now Financially Material

| Project | Core Assumption | ROI Framework |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **02 - Carbon Footprint** | Carbon pricing accelerating (€85-120/ton CO2e); reduction = cost savings | 30% Scope 3 reduction = €127-180K/year savings potential |
| **05 - Living Income** | Income stabilization + farmer premium → yield + quality uplift | 3-5 year ROI breakeven on farmer income support investment |
| **06 - Logistics** | Route optimization + consolidation → cost + carbon aligned | 12-20% cost savings + 25-35% carbon reduction within 12 months |

**Unified assumption:** ESG is no longer "cost center" narrative. It's ROI positive within 3-5 years when properly structured. Finance teams have case to approve budget.

---

### Theme 3: Regulation is the Hard Constraint

| Project | Core Assumption | Hard Deadline |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **03 - CSRD Readiness** | CSRD mandatory 2027-2028; large-cap reporting starts 2025 | No optionality; compliance is table stakes by year-end 2026 |
| **01 - Supply ESG** | CSDDD mandates supply chain due diligence by 2027; overlaps CSRD | Data infrastructure for CSRD doubles as CSDDD infrastructure |
| **05 - Living Income** | CSDDD Labor/human rights due diligence requires income visibility | Farm-level income data is now regulatory requirement, not nice-to-have |

**Unified assumption:** No company avoids CSRD + CSDDD. Those who start NOW (Q1 2026) have 18 months planning room. Those who delay face vertical learning curve + audit failure risk 2027-2028.

## 🔑 Key Insight for Leadership

**"We are not doing ESG because it's ethical; we're doing it because it's operationally and financially necessary. CSRD + CSDDD are regulatory rails that will force us into this analysis anyway. The companies that build the infrastructure NOW—while they have planning room—will be ahead of competitors. By 2027-2028, all mid-size importers will have ESG data systems. First movers will have strategic insights; late movers will be in compliance firefighting."**

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Approve data infrastructure investment** (€50-100K): Central data warehouse serving all 6 projects
2. **Launch Phase 1** (CSRD + ESG intelligence): Start Q1 2026
3. **Establish governance:** Single steering committee across all 6 projects (not siloed)
4. **Communicate strategy:** Board alignment + team buy-in
